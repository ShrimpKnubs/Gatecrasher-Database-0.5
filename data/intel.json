        "content": " 5th SFG Airborne is being deployed near Pleiku, South Vietnam to conduct counter insurgency guerilla tactics with local militias and ARVN troops in the Area. With the addition of a Choctaw Marine CAS Crew. They will help not only train but directly engage the enemy which is a mixture of Viet Cong guerillas and NVA regulars. It's believed that the Politiburo in Hanoi is working with the Chinese and possibly even the Soviets to arm a full frontal attack on the South. We must create an autonomous fighting force by direct order of SECDEF Robert McNamara. We already have our One-Zero on the ground who was hired by CIA to assist the 5th SFG."
